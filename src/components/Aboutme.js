  <p>Ever since I was a young child solving problems has been my passion, I still remember at the age of 8 when ever I would enter a large room I would try and calculate how many people could fit in that room. As years progressed I became very interested in the Arabic language which lead me to travel abroad  and learn the language in depth. It was during my time learning the Arabic where a friend of mine introduced me to software developing and as soon as I had done a few JavaScript Katas on codewars. I knew that this was the only career path I could pursue.
    I am currently a software Engineer trainee at Norhcoders coding school and i am looking for a challenging career to allow me to put my skills and experience into practice.</p><br/><h2>Technical skills</h2><p>Technical skills Languages React, JavaScript (JS), HTML5, CSS3, Backend express, SQL node-postgress, knex Testing Jest, supertest, Sinon, mocha</p></div></div>)
